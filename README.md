# CMSIS-SVD Schema Collection

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of CMSIS-SVD Schema Definitions.

CMSIS-SVD is a standardized format for describing the memory mapped registers of microcontroller peripherals.
These schemas provide validation rules and structure definitions for creating and verifying SVD files.

## Contents

This repository contains the XSD schema files for multiple CMSIS-SVD specification versions.
XSD schema files are stored in the `schemas/` folder and use the `CMSIS-SVD_*.xsd` name format where the wildcard is the version of the corresponding standard.

The `metadata.txt` file contains the source URLs for each schema file.
